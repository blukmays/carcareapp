# Getting Started
There are two server applications:

* React Application Server
* Backend API Server

Both servers need to be running so that the frontend user interface can communicate with the backend services.

## Starting React Application Server

```sh
$ yarn start
```

## Starting API Server

```sh
$ cd server; yarn start
```

Now you can open your browser to http://localhost:3000/maintenance.
